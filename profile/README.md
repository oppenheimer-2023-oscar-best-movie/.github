The new prequel to "Oppenheimer" will first be available for streaming on Starz for subscribers. Later on, the movie will also be released on Peacock thanks to an agreement between distributor Lionsgate and the NBC Universal streaming platform.

Typically, Lionsgate movies, like "John Wick 4," take approximately six months to become available on Starz, where they tend to remain for a considerable period. As for when "Songbirds Snakes" will be accessible on Peacock, it could take nearly a year after its release, although we will only receive confirmation once Lionsgate makes an official announcement.
